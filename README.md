**static-php-cli** is a powerful tool designed for building static, standalone PHP runtime
with popular extensions.

## Features

- :handbag: Build single-file PHP executable with zero dependencies
- :hamburger:Build **[phpmicro](https://github.com/dixyes/phpmicro)** self-extracting executables (combines PHP binary and source code into one file)
- :pill: Automatic build environment checker with auto-fix capabilities
- :zap: `Linux`, `macOS`, `FreeBSD`, `Windows` support
- :wrench: Configurable source code patching
- :books: Intelligent dependency management
- ðŸ“¦ Self-contained `spc` executable (built with [box](https://github.com/box-project/box))
- :fire: Support 75+ popular [extensions](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/extensions.html)
- :floppy_disk: UPX compression support (reduces binary size by 30-50%)

**Single-file standalone php-cli:**

## Quickstart

### 1. Download spc binary

```bash
# For Linux x86_64
curl -fsSL -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-linux-x86_64
# For Linux aarch64
curl -fsSL -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-linux-aarch64
# macOS x86_64 (Intel)
curl -fsSL -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-macos-x86_64
# macOS aarch64 (Apple)
curl -fsSL -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-macos-aarch64
# Windows (x86_64, win10 build 17063 or later, please install VS2022 first)
curl.exe -fsSL -o spc.exe https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-windows-x64.exe
```

For macOS and Linux, add execute permission first:

```bash
chmod +x ./spc
```

### 2. Build Static PHP

First, create a `craft.yml` file and specify which extensions you want to include from [extension list](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/extensions.html) or [command generator](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/cli-generator.html):

```yml
# PHP version support: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
php-version: 8.4
# Put your extension list here
extensions: "apcu,bcmath,calendar,ctype,curl,dba,dom,exif,fileinfo,filter,gd,iconv,mbregex,mbstring,mysqli,mysqlnd,opcache,openssl,pcntl,pdo,pdo_mysql,pdo_sqlite,phar,posix,readline,redis,session,simplexml,sockets,sodium,sqlite3,tokenizer,xml,xmlreader,xmlwriter,xsl,zip,zlib"
sapi:
  - cli
  - micro
  - fpm
download-options:
  prefer-pre-built: true
```

Run command:

```bash
./spc craft

# Output full console log
./spc craft --debug
```

### 3. Static PHP usage

Now you can copy binaries built by static-php-cli to another machine and run with no dependencies:

```
# All executables are located in buildroot/bin/ directory
# php-cli
buildroot/bin/php -v

# phpmicro
echo '<?php echo "Hello world!\n";' > a.php
./spc micro:combine a.php -O my-app
./my-app

# php-fpm
buildroot/bin/php-fpm -v
```

## Documentation

The current README contains basic usage. For all the features of static-php-cli,
see <https://static-php.dev> .

## Direct Download

If you don't want to build or want to test first, you can download example pre-compiled artifact from [Actions](https://github.com/static-php/static-php-cli-hosted/actions/workflows/build-php-bulk.yml), or from self-hosted server.

Below are several precompiled static-php binaries with different extension combinations,
which can be downloaded directly according to your needs.

| Combination                                                          | Extension Count                                                            | OS           | Comment                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| [common](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/common/)           | [30+](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/common/README.txt)          | Linux, macOS | The binary size is about 7.5MB |
| [bulk](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/bulk/)               | [50+](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/bulk/README.txt)            | Linux, macOS | The binary size is about 25MB  |
| [minimal](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/minimal/)         | [5](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/minimal/README.txt)           | Linux, macOS | The binary size is about 3MB   |
| [spc-min](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/windows/spc-min/) | [5](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/windows/spc-min/README.txt)   | Windows      | The binary size is about 3MB   |
| [spc-max](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/windows/spc-max/) | [40+](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/windows/spc-max/README.txt) | Windows      | The binary size is about 8.5MB |

> Linux and Windows supports UPX compression for binaries, which can reduce the size of the binary by 30% to 50%.
> macOS does not support UPX compression, so the size of the pre-built binaries for mac is larger.

### Build Online (using GitHub Actions)

Use GitHub Action to easily build a statically compiled PHP,
and at the same time define the extensions to be compiled by yourself.

1. Fork me.
2. Go to the Actions of the project and select `CI`.
3. Select `Run workflow`, fill in the PHP version you want to compile, the target type, and the list of extensions. (extensions comma separated, e.g. `bcmath,curl,mbstring`)
4. After waiting for about a period of time, enter the corresponding task and get `Artifacts`.

If you enable `debug`, all logs will be output at build time, including compiled logs, for troubleshooting.

## Contribution

If the extension you need is missing, you can create an issue.
If you are familiar with this project, you are also welcome to initiate a pull request.

If you want to contribute documentation, please just edit in `docs/`.

Now there is a [static-php](https://github.com/static-php) organization, which is used to store the repo related to the project.

## Sponsor this project

You can sponsor me or my project from [GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/crazywhalecc). A portion of your donation will be used to maintain the **static-php.dev** server.
