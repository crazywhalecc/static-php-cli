**static-php-cli** is a powerful tool designed for building static, standalone PHP runtime
with popular extensions.

Static PHP built by **static-php-cli** supports `cli`, `fpm`, `embed` and `micro` SAPI.

**static-php-cli** also has the ability to package PHP projects
along with the PHP interpreter into one single executable file.

- :hamburger: Build **[phpmicro](https://github.com/dixyes/phpmicro)** self-extracted executable (glue php binary and php source code into one file)
- :pill: Automatic build environment checker (Doctor module)
- :zap: `Linux`, `macOS`, `FreeBSD`, `Windows` support
- :wrench: Configurable source code patches
- :books: Build dependency management
- ðŸ“¦ Provide `spc` own standalone executable (built by spc and [box](https://github.com/box-project/box))
- :fire: Support many popular [extensions](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/extensions.html)

## Documentation

The current README contains basic usage. For all the features of static-php-cli,
see <https://static-php.dev> .

## Direct Download

If you don't want to build or want to test first, you can download example pre-compiled artifact from [Actions](https://github.com/static-php/static-php-cli-hosted/actions/workflows/build-php-bulk.yml), or from self-hosted server.

Below are several precompiled static-php binaries with different extension combinations,
which can be downloaded directly according to your needs.

- [Extension-Combination - common](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/common/): `common` contains about [30+](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/common/README.txt) commonly used extensions, and the size is about 22MB.
- [Extension-Combination - bulk](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/bulk/): `bulk` contains [50+](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/bulk/README.txt) extensions and is about 70MB in size.
- [Extension-Combination - minimal](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/minimal/): `minimal` contains [5](https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/minimal/README.txt) extensions and is about 6MB in size.

## Build

### Compilation Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1 (This is the version required by spc itself, not the build version)
- Extension: `mbstring,pcntl,posix,tokenizer,phar`
- Supported OS with `curl` and `git` installed

You can say I made a PHP builder written in PHP, pretty funny.
But static-php-cli runtime only requires an environment above PHP 8.1 and `mbstring`, `pcntl` extension.

Here is the supported OS and arch, where :octocat: represents support for GitHub Action builds,
:computer: represents support for local manual builds, and blank represents not currently supported.

|         | x86_64               | aarch64              |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| macOS   | :octocat: :computer: | :octocat: :computer: |
| Linux   | :octocat: :computer: | :octocat: :computer: |
| Windows | :computer:           |                      |
| FreeBSD | :computer:           | :computer:           |

Currently supported PHP versions for compilation are: `7.3`, `7.4`, `8.0`, `8.1`, `8.2`, `8.3`.

### Supported Extensions

Please first select the extension you want to compile based on the extension list below.

- [Supported Extension List](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/extensions.html)
- [Command Generator](https://static-php.dev/en/guide/cli-generator.html)

> If an extension you need is missing, you can submit an issue.

Here is the current planned roadmap for extension support: [#152](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli/issues/152) .

### Build Online (using GitHub Actions)

Use GitHub Action to easily build a statically compiled PHP,
and at the same time define the extensions to be compiled by yourself.

1. Fork me.
2. Go to the Actions of the project and select `CI`.
3. Select `Run workflow`, fill in the PHP version you want to compile, the target type, and the list of extensions. (extensions comma separated, e.g. `bcmath,curl,mbstring`)
4. After waiting for about a period of time, enter the corresponding task and get `Artifacts`.

If you enable `debug`, all logs will be output at build time, including compiled logs, for troubleshooting.

### Build Locally (using SPC binary)

This project provides a binary file of static-php-cli: `spc`.
You can use `spc` binary instead of installing any runtime like golang app.
Currently, the platforms supported by `spc` binary are Linux and macOS.

Download from self-hosted nightly builds using commands below:

```bash
# Download from self-hosted nightly builds (sync with main branch)
# For Linux x86_64
curl -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-linux-x86_64
# For Linux aarch64
curl -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-linux-aarch64
# macOS x86_64 (Intel)
curl -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-macos-x86_64
# macOS aarch64 (Apple)
curl -o spc https://dl.static-php.dev/static-php-cli/spc-bin/nightly/spc-macos-aarch64

# add x perm
chmod +x ./spc
./spc --version
```

Self-hosted `spc` is built by GitHub Actions, you can also download from Actions artifacts [here](https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli/actions/workflows/release-build.yml).

### Build Locally (using git source)

```bash
# just clone me!
git clone https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli.git
```

If you have not installed php on your system, we recommend that you use the built-in setup-runtime to install PHP and Composer automatically.

```bash
cd static-php-cli
chmod +x bin/setup-runtime
# it will download static php (from self-hosted server) and composer (from getcomposer)
bin/setup-runtime
# initialize composer deps
bin/composer install
# chmod
chmod +x bin/spc
bin/spc --version
```

### Start Building PHP

Basic usage for building php with some extensions:

> If you are using the packaged `spc` binary, you need to replace `bin/spc` with `./spc` in the following commands.

```bash
# Check system tool dependencies, auto-fix them if possible
./bin/spc doctor --auto-fix

# fetch all libraries
./bin/spc download --all
# only fetch necessary sources by needed extensions (recommended)
./bin/spc download --for-extensions=openssl,pcntl,mbstring,pdo_sqlite
# download different PHP version (--with-php=x.y, recommend 7.3 ~ 8.3)
./bin/spc download --for-extensions=openssl,curl,mbstring --with-php=8.1

# with bcmath,openssl,tokenizer,sqlite3,pdo_sqlite,ftp,curl extension, build both CLI and phpmicro SAPI
./bin/spc build bcmath,openssl,tokenizer,sqlite3,pdo_sqlite,ftp,curl --build-cli --build-micro
# build thread-safe (ZTS) version (--enable-zts)
./bin/spc build curl,phar --enable-zts --build-cli
```

Now we support `cli`, `micro`, `fpm` and `embed` SAPI. You can use one or more of the following parameters to specify the compiled SAPI:

- `--build-cli`: build static cli executable
- `--build-micro`: build static phpmicro self-extracted executable
- `--build-fpm`: build static fpm binary
- `--build-embed`: build embed (libphp)
- `--build-all`: build all

If anything goes wrong, use `--debug` option to display full terminal output:

```bash
./bin/spc build openssl,pcntl,mbstring --debug --build-all
./bin/spc download --all --debug
```

## Different SAPI Usage

### Use cli

> php-cli is a single static binary, you can use it like normal php installed on your system.

When using the parameter `--build-cli` or `--build-all`,
the final compilation result will output a binary file named `./php`,
which can be distributed and used directly.
This file will be located in the directory `buildroot/bin/`, copy it out for use.

```bash
cd buildroot/bin/
./php -v                # check version
./php -m                # check extensions
./php your_code.php     # run your php code
./php your_project.phar # run your phar (project archive)
```

### Use micro

> phpmicro is a SelF-extracted eXecutable SAPI module,
> provided by [phpmicro](https://github.com/dixyes/phpmicro) project.
> But this project is using a [fork](https://github.com/static-php/phpmicro) of phpmicro, because we need to add some features to it.
> It can put php runtime and your source code together.

When using the parameter `--build-all` or `--build-micro`,
the final compilation result will output a file named `./micro.sfx`,
which needs to be used with your PHP source code like `code.php`.
This file will be located in the path `buildroot/bin/micro.sfx`, simply copy it out for use.

Prepare your project source code, which can be a single PHP file or a Phar file, for use.

```bash
echo "<?php echo 'Hello world' . PHP_EOL;" > code.php
cat micro.sfx code.php > single-app && chmod +x single-app
./single-app
```

If you package a PHAR file, just replace `code.php` with the phar file path.
You can use [box-project/box](https://github.com/box-project/box) to package your CLI project as Phar,
It is then combined with phpmicro to produce a standalone executable binary.

```bash
# Use the micro.sfx generated by static-php-cli to combine,
bin/spc micro:combine my-app.phar
# or you can directly use the cat command to combine them.
cat buildroot/bin/micro.sfx my-app.phar > my-app && chmod +x my-app

# Use micro:combine combination to inject INI options into the binary.
bin/spc micro:combine my-app.phar -I "memory_limit=4G" -I "disable_functions=system" --output my-app-2
```

> In some cases, PHAR files may not run in a micro environment. Overall, micro is not production ready.

### Use fpm

When using the parameter `--build-all` or `--build-fpm`,
the final compilation result will output a file named `./php-fpm`,
This file will be located in the path `buildroot/bin/`, simply copy it out for use.

In common Linux distributions and macOS systems, the package manager will automatically generate a default fpm configuration file after installing php-fpm.
Because php-fpm must specify a configuration file before running, the php-fpm compiled by this project will not have any configuration files, so you need to write `php-fpm.conf` and `pool.conf` configuration files yourself.

Specifying `php-fpm.conf` can use the command parameter `-y`, for example: `./php-fpm -y php-fpm.conf`.

### Use embed

When using the project parameters `--build-embed` or `--build-all`,
the final compilation result will output a `libphp.a`, `php-config` and a series of header files,
stored in `buildroot/`. You can introduce them in your other projects.

If you know [embed SAPI](https://github.com/php/php-src/tree/master/sapi/embed), you should know how to use it.
You may require the introduction of other libraries during compilation,
you can use `buildroot/bin/php-config` to obtain the compile-time configuration.

For an advanced example of how to use this feature, take a look at [how to use it to build a static version of FrankenPHP](https://github.com/dunglas/frankenphp/blob/main/docs/static.md).
