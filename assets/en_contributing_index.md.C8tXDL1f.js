Before development, if you are not familiar with it, Check out the <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">symfony/console documentation</a> first.</p><h3 id="security-update" tabindex="-1">Security Update <a class="header-anchor" href="#security-update" aria-label="Permalink to “Security Update”">​</a></h3><p>Because this project is basically a PHP project running locally, generally speaking, there will be no remote attacks.

It will be covered in detail in the next section on this page. In general, you will need:</p><ol><li>Evaluate whether the extension can be compiled inline into PHP.</li><li>Evaluate whether the extension&#39;s dependent libraries (if any) can be compiled statically.</li><li>Write library compile commands on different platforms.</li><li>Verify that the extension and its dependencies are compatible with existing extensions and dependencies.</li><li>Verify that the extension works normally in <code>cli</code>, <code>micro</code>, <code>fpm</code>, <code>embed</code> SAPIs.</li><li>Write documentation and add your extension.</li></ol><h3 id="project-framework-optimization" tabindex="-1">Project Framework Optimization <a class="header-anchor" href="#project-framework-optimization" aria-label="Permalink to “Project Framework Optimization”">​</a></h3><p>If you are already familiar with the working principle of <code>symfony/console</code>, and at the same time want to make some modifications or optimizations to the framework of the project, please understand the following things first:</p><ol><li>Adding extensions does not belong to project framework optimization, but if you find that you have to optimize the framework when adding new extensions, you need to modify the framework itself before adding extensions.</li><li>For some large-scale logical modifications (such as those involving LibraryBase, Extension objects, etc.), it is recommended to submit an Issue or Draft PR for discussion first.</li><li>In the early stage of the project, it was a pure private development project, and there were some Chinese comments in the code. After internationalizing your project you can submit a PR to translate these comments into English.</li><li>Please do not submit more useless code fragments in the code, such as a large number of unused variables, methods, classes, and code that has been rewritten many times.</li></ol>',18)]))}const p=t(a,[["render",r]]);export{m as __pageData,p as default};
