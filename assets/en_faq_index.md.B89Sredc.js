However, static linking has different definitions in different operating systems.</p><p>First of all, for Linux systems, statically linked binaries will not link the system&#39;s dynamic link library. Purely statically linked binaries (<code>build with -all-static</code>) cannot load dynamic libraries, so new extensions cannot be added. At the same time, in pure static mode, you cannot use extensions such as <code>ffi</code> to load external <code>.so</code> modules.</p><p>You can use the command <code>ldd buildroot/bin/php</code> to check whether the binary you built under Linux is purely statically linked.</p><p>If you <a href="./../guide/build-with-glibc.html">build GNU libc based PHP</a>, you can use the <code>ffi</code> extension to load external <code>.so</code> modules and load <code>.so</code> extensions with the same ABI.</p><p>For example, you can use the following command to build a static PHP binary dynamically linked with glibc, supporting FFI extensions and loading the <code>xdebug.so</code> extension of the same PHP version and the same TS type:</p><div class="language-bash"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang">bash</span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark" style="--shiki-light:#24292e;--shiki-dark:#e1e4e8;--shiki-light-bg:#fff;--shiki-dark-bg:#24292e;" tabindex="0" dir="ltr"><code><span class="line"><span style="--shiki-light:#6F42C1;--shiki-dark:#B392F0;">bin/spc-gnu-docker</span><span style="--shiki-light:#032F62;--shiki-dark:#9ECBFF;"> download</span><span style="--shiki-light:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#79B8FF;"> --for-extensions=ffi,xml</span><span style="--shiki-light:#005CC5;--shiki-dark:#79B8FF;"> --with-php=8.4</span></span>

These extensions cannot be compiled into static-php-cli using source code, so this project may never support these extensions. However, in theory you can access and use such extensions under macOS and Linux according to the above questions.</p><p>If you have a need for such extensions, or most people have needs for these closed-source extensions, see the discussion on <a href="https://github.com/crazywhalecc/static-php-cli/discussions/58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">standalone-php-cli</a>.

Windows support is not perfect. There are mainly the following problems:</p><ol><li>The compilation process of Windows is different from that of *nix, and the toolchain used is also different. The compilation tools used to compile the dependent libraries of each extension are almost completely different.</li><li>The demand for the Windows version will also be advanced based on the needs of all people who use this project.

I saw on the Internet that there is a project called BPC (Binary PHP Compiler?) that can compile PHP into binary, but there are many restrictions.</p><p>The direction of encrypting and protecting the code is not the same as compiling. After compiling, the code can also be obtained through reverse engineering and other methods. The real protection is still carried out by means of packing and encrypting the code.</p><p>Therefore, this project (static-php-cli) and related projects (lwmbs, swoole-cli) all provide a convenient compilation tool for php-src source code. The phpmicro referenced by this project and related projects is only a package of PHP&#39;s sapi interface, not a compilation tool for PHP code. The compiler for PHP code is a completely different project, so the extra cases are not taken into account. If you are interested in encryption, you can consider using existing encryption technologies, such as Swoole Compiler, Source Guardian, etc.</p><h2 id="unable-to-use-ssl" tabindex="-1">Unable to use ssl <a class="header-anchor" href="#unable-to-use-ssl" aria-label="Permalink to “Unable to use ssl”">​</a></h2><p><strong>Update: This issue has been fixed in the latest version of static-php-cli, which now reads the system&#39;s certificate file by default.

This error is caused by statically compiled PHP without specifying <code>openssl.cafile</code> via <code>php.ini</code>.</p><p>You can solve this problem by specifying <code>php.ini</code> before using PHP and adding <code>openssl.cafile=/path/to/your-cert.pem</code> in the INI.</p><p>For Linux systems, you can download the <a href="https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">cacert.pem</a> file from the curl official website, or you can use the certificate file that comes with the system.

In addition, many older versions of PHP are not compatible with the latest dependency libraries, which is one of the reasons why older versions of PHP are not supported.</p><p>You can use older versions compiled earlier by static-php-cli, such as PHP 8.0, but earlier versions will not be explicitly supported.</p>`,35)])])}const f=i(a,[["render",n]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
