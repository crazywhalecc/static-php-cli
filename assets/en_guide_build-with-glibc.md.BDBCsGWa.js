This means that the compiled static PHP executable can be used on almost any Linux distribution without worrying about the versions of libc, libstdc++, etc.</p><p>However, there are some issues with pure static linking of musl-libc binaries on Linux:</p><ul><li>The <code>dl()</code> function in PHP cannot be used to load dynamic libraries and external PHP extensions.</li><li>The FFI extension in PHP cannot be used.</li><li>In some extreme cases, performance issues may occur. See <a href="https://github.com/php/php-src/issues/13648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">musl-libc performance issues</a>.</li></ul><p>Different Linux distributions use different default libc. For example, Alpine Linux uses musl libc, while most Linux distributions use glibc. However, even so, we cannot directly use any distribution using glibc to build portable static binaries because glibc has some issues:</p><ul><li>Binaries built with gcc and other tools on newer versions of distributions cannot run on older versions of distributions.</li><li>glibc is not recommended to be statically linked because some of its features require the support of dynamic libraries.</li></ul><p>However, we can use Docker to solve this problem. The final output is a binary <strong>dynamically linked with glibc</strong> and some necessary libraries, but <strong>statically linked with all other dependencies</strong>.</p><ol><li>Use an older version of a Linux distribution (such as CentOS 7.x), which has an older version of glibc but can run on most modern Linux distributions.</li><li>Build the static binary of PHP in this container so that it can run on most modern Linux distributions.</li></ol><blockquote><p>Using glibc static binaries can run on most modern Linux distributions but cannot run on musl libc distributions, such as CentOS 6, Alpine Linux, etc.</p></blockquote><h2 id="build-glibc-compatible-linux-binary-1" tabindex="-1">Build glibc Compatible Linux Binary <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-glibc-compatible-linux-binary-1" aria-label="Permalink to “Build glibc Compatible Linux Binary”">​</a></h2><p>The latest version of static-php-cli includes the <code>bin/spc-gnu-docker</code> script, which can create a CentOS 7.x (glibc-2.17) Docker container with one click and build a glibc compatible PHP static binary in the container.</p><p>Then, run the following command once.
